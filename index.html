			<h3>An Excellent Manager</h3>
			<p>
				Since my teenage years I have always had to manage teams. It started in college in Cameroon where I was organizing work sessions in 
				the chemistry laboratory for more than 30 people. Then in Germany where I had the idea to create the Pan-African association ADI 
				which counts today more than 2100 members throughout the world and which I preside besides my full-time job as Devops Engineer. 
				Thanks to this association we had the chance to organize  the NASA Space App challenge in the City of Kaiserslautern in October 2021 in Germany.

				to build synchronised Companies in Africa.With this in mind, I have succeeded in creating a community of Cameroonians from the German Diaspora
				 who are currently investing every year close to 380,000 euros in Cameroon in synchronized businesses.It is the first time to have such a community 
				 of Cameroonians in Germany, That is awesome! and We are open for partnership.
